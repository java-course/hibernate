Advantages
This is the easiest method of Inheritance mapping to implement.

Disadvantages
Data thats belongs to a parent class is scattered across a number of subclass tables, which represents concrete classes.
This hierarchy is not recommended for most cases.
Changes to a parent class is reflected to large number of tables
A query couched in terms of parent class is likely to cause a large number of select operations
